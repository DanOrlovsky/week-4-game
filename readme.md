## Story  
---
Life has been hard for our 8-bit favorites.  Kids no longer exhaust hours attempting to get them through amazing adventures, and they are craving some 
action.  They decided to turn this desire into a battle arena and face off against each other!

### Instructions   
---
Your objective is to defeat all opponents.  
  
Characters have a ready-bar that lets the player know who is ready to attack.  To attack, either hit the 'A' key on your keyboard, or mouse-click the word 'ATTACK'
on the battle-screen.  If you tap 'A' again right before you hit your opponent, you may administer a critical attack!  
  
Players can also defend against attacks by hitting the 'D' key or mouse-click the word 'DEFEND' **right before** your opponent attacks you!  

Good luck!!
